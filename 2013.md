      - "Planning for 3 flavors eventually: Developers, Researchers (external to organization), Researchers/Analysts (within organization)"
      - VM to contain all tools necessary to get started immediately with open data analysis or development -- should be a minimal setup process (3 steps?)
      - Also future plans to generate OpenData DevOps community to continue effort in this direction
      - Use the instructions in the README file on Github (above) to try out our baseline image!

      - "An ongoing project of Code for DC: http://www.codefordc.org/.  To do something interesting and valuable for DC parents and students to  help them better navigate school lotteries and decisions. We are  collecting data about schools, and how decisions are made about schools  and lotteries, with the goal of aggregating open data, collecting new  data, and eventually/hopefully building decision-support tools."
      - We learned a tremendous amount about the current state of school data, and the possibility of integrating data sources of eclectic sorts in a future tool for parents.

      - Cleaned and merged data from three different social service directories (2-1-1, Bread for the City, the BRIDGE Project). 
      - Merged this clean file with a database including Federal 990 data of every non-profit in DC (via Urban Institute)
      - Geocoded the data! 
      - "Next steps:"
      - stand file up in an Open Data Catalog (which can also host other local data sets) - 80% ready
      - prepare tagsonomy-coding interface + instructions for service providers and other community members, so that we can organize the data 
      - "then, import data into apps such as local wiki: www.districtcommons.org and Open211"
      - Establish cooperative data management plan

    text:
      - "Picloud notebook to visualize global earthquake data as a map. There were a few speedbumps with mpl toolkits not loading in the picloud basemap. But setting up an environment in linux helped with this. Ideally, we would be able to create a short suite of excercises in python for an introductory curriculum that could allow for interactive programmin on the same template. The example is a map, but ideally we could also create time series of perhaps USDA crop data over time, a network graph node/edge diagram relating NGOs to relevant data that they collect and provide, and then a scraper in python to scrape data (maybe nutrition data from the USDA) create a full suite of short excercises under a food security or relevant climate conditions theme."

      - "This new community may serve as a neutral ground where open data geeeks and data owners/experts can meet to talk about data and tools to better use the data that is already available on one of the open data catalogs such as data.gov and data.gov.uk. As well as starting point to discover new datasets inside government and help it to liberate them for public good."

I have a dataset of 20,000 tweets (in multiple languages) but tagged to sector and country. Is anyone interested in exploring this data with me?'

      - "It would be helpful to identify similar legislation introduced by different authors  in the same congress, or in different congress. Any bills above a  particular threshhold of similarity (95%?) would be identified as  virtually identical or related pieces of legislation."
      - "We're marking up bills in Congress with semantically rich XML. (Take a look: http://deepbills.dancingmammoth.com/download) But many bills repeat the same text - sometimes bills are identical, sometimes one bill incorporates another. We need to find identity between texts in bills and copy our markup from one to the other."
