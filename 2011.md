      - The theme of our hackathon was open government data, and participants worked on improving access to U.S. law, scanning federal spending for anomalies following Benford’s Law, understanding farm subsidy grants, building local transit apps, and keeping Congress accountable. Only about half of the participants were programmers, but everyone found a way to be involved.
